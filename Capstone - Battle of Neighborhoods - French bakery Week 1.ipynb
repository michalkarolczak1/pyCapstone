Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders who are interested in <b>opening a French Bakery in New York, USA.</b><br><br>\n    New York is one the biggest cities in the world. It's both one of the largest economical center of the world and one of the most popular tourist attraction. With an estimated 2019 population of 8,336,817 distributed over about 302.6 square miles and a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of $2.0 trillion makes New York one of the most popular places to invest and open business there. There are many bakeries in NYC, we will conclude whare are the existing bakeries and also find locations where there are none. The report will explore in which neighborhoods and boroughs of NYC the most  bakeries are located and where to open new French bakery."

French bakery specializes in french bread, pastries and sweets which allows it to run both as morning place to buy bread and also as a place to buy takeaway or get a small-medium lunch\nIt's a competetive market so some assumptions have been made:<br>\n    1. it would be good to open new bakery where there are none or small number of bakeries<br>\n    2. as a hint for finding the best place it would be good to find locations with French Restaurants as bakery won't be the competitions to the restaurant (offers small takeaway meals) but would be located near other French joints - People in the area might be interested in additional French meals<br>"
